Baseball Code
The Baseball R code should be run using the truncated dataset--this is the R Shiny App we created.
The cluster R code should be run using the 2021 player sample code.
The cluster code was created during research but was not ultimately adapted into our final product
Here is the link to the finished R Shiny Program
